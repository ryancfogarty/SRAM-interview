# SRAM-interview

***Project details***
This project will allow the user to explore Strava segments near their location. If time permits, the app will also allow the user to explore segments for an arbitrary location by allowing them to set an exploration zone via Google maps.  

For the MVP, the app will allow the user to login and search for segments near their location. If time permits, I will iterate with the following improvements:
1. Display results on an embedded Google Maps display and link to the Google Maps app for directions to the segment starting point
2. Allow the user to set a zone of exploration to search for segments in an arbitrary location
3. Improve the UI, as it will be fairly basic in the MVP
4. Control the size of the exploration zone
5. Add additional fields (min climb cat & max climb cat) to the search
